# ⛏️ SDDE - Mineral Data Mining

**SDDE** (Statistical and Descriptive Data Exploration) is a project focused on the exploratory analysis of mineralogical image data using modern techniques from image processing, multivariate statistics, and unsupervised learning. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and mineralogical structures based on imaging-derived features.

## 🧪 Project Objectives

- Perform **feature extraction** from mineral images (e.g., texture, intensity, morphology)
- Apply **dimensionality reduction techniques** (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to visualize complex data
- Use **clustering algorithms** to identify natural groupings of mineral structures
- Analyze **correlations** between chemical composition and image descriptors
- Build a reproducible and modular data mining pipeline for future mineral datasets
